# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator
This homework assignment was about how to make an website that can generate a password. A password generator website showcases my basic skills and talents of the HTML and CSS skills that i learned in class.

## Given Task

This week’s homework required us to modify the starter code to create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that they’ve selected. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that i write. It will have a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.

## Given User Story

```
AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security
```

## Completed Acceptance Criteria

```
WHEN clicked the button to generate a password
-GIVEN option of a new, secure password.
WHEN prompted for password criteria
-GIVEN a series of prompts for password criteria.
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
-GIVEN which criteria to include in the password.
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
-GIVEN an Alert to choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters.
WHEN I answer each prompt
-GIVEN an option to confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters.
WHEN all prompts are answered
-GIVEN the password is generated and the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page.
```
